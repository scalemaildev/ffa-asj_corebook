\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
\section*{Introduction}
\emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey} is a single-player conversion of the original Fires Far Away: a pen \& paper homebrew developed by an anonymous poster(s?) on the 4chan /tg/ board. As of the Spring of 2021, the original rulebooks are still available at \url{https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Fires_Far_Away}.

\section*{Themes}
\subsection*{Scarce Vistas}
The player is not inundated with illustrations, explanations, or exposition. An imagination will have to paint in the whites left reserved by the scenario.

\subsection*{Stern Diktats}
The game is designed to be stern, but not cruel. The goal is to challenge the player’s mind and rattle their playstyle, not crush their character in a random or merciless fashion.

\subsection*{Rigid Chances}
Like the original homebrew, \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey} eschews dice rolls as a resolution mechanic whenever possible. A small amount of randomness is present, but the game favors flat success conditions. The outcome of the character’s actions is not dependent on rolling well, but rather playing well to the rolls.

\subsection*{Vorpal Encounters}
No scenario should contain any throwaway encounters or ‘trash mobs’. Each encounter should be a puzzle in and of itself, pitting the character against a mortal and uniquely challenging threat.

\subsection*{Beggared Allowances}
All mechanics are based around low arithmetic, making them easily tracked via tokens, coins, pencil marks, beads, or even fingers. No need for an abacus or similar such apparatus.

\subsection*{Beleaguered Narratives}
The player is not expected to surmount every obstacle or defeat every enemy. A scenario is a story as much as it is a challenge, and every well-told tale traverses both valleys and summits.

\subsection*{Convoluted Timelines}
Unique to \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey}, the player is not likely to experience a scenario in any canonical order. The furtive element of randomness rears its head here; each scenario is broken into chapters that are played in order of draw.

\subsection*{Unreliable Recollections}
As the player makes their way through a scenario, they will occasionally be asked to take notes on their actions’ outcomes. These notes are referenced later in play, even if that means being referenced earlier in the scenario’s timeline. The same holds true for the character’s equipment and advancements, which have a habit of flaunting the laws of time and space. Memories in this game are somewhat unreliable, so players should try not to grow too attached to them.

\section{Game Structure}
\emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey} is played in three phases: \textbf{character creation}, \textbf{scenario resolution}, and the scenario’s \textbf{\emph{prestige}}.

\subsection{Character Creation}
This phase is unique to each scenario or campaign. Its scenario book will lead the player through the process of creating a character, including their starting statistics, equipment, and other pertinent details. This might be done through selecting a background, answering questions, rolling dice, overt point buys, or any number of creative methods.
\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} The scenario may alter some statistics, or add new ones. A thoughtful scenario will provide the player with a customized character sheet on which to record these new details.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Scenario Resolution}
Each scenario is split into several chapters, and each chapter functions as a self-contained adventure which both influences—and is influenced by—the events in its sister stories.

\subsubsection*{Scenario Setup and Resolution}
Complete the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Refer to the scenario book for a list of chapters, and any special setup instructions
\item Write each chapter’s number or symbol on the face of a separate index card
\item Gather these cards into a deck, and shuffle them face-down
\item One by one, draw each card from this chapter deck and resolve the written chapter
\item After each chapter is resolved, discard its card and draw the next one
\item When the entire chapter deck is exhausted, continue onto the scenario’s \emph{prestige}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{What Carries from Chapter to Chapter?}
As a general rule, everything is retained unless the scenario specifies otherwise. This includes equipment, character advancements, and any permanent notes from previous chapters.\\
Some equipment and items are \reftoit{Ephemeral}, and are erased after the chapter in which they are found. The player should never erase anything else from their character sheet or stash, even if it seems asinine that they would still be available. The character’s memory of the scenario’s events is hazy at best; some logical inconsistencies are to be expected.

\subsection{The \emph{Prestige}}
In the climax of each scenario, the fruits of the character’s toils are finally revealed. The knotted timeline is unraveled, answering some questions and perhaps presenting more. The logical inconsistencies of the scenario’s telling become clearer in hindsight, and the player is asked to forgive their character’s mind for its follies and fabrications.\\
The scenario’s \emph{prestige} may or may not contain additional encounters or CYOA segments.

\subsubsection*{Campaign Play}
Some scenarios are merely links in the chain of a greater campaign, and their \emph{prestige} is used to sand out the rough edges of the matryoshka in preparation for the next layer. Unlike chapters, the player is expected to play a campaign’s scenarios in sequential order. Unless instructed otherwise, the player should assume that all their equipment and advancements will be retained upon progressing to another scenario in the same campaign.\\
Scenarios that are not part of a campaign are meant to be one-shots, and are not balanced for playing with the veteran of a separate adventure. 

\vfill

\subsection{Required Materials}
In order to facilitate smooth gameplay, it is recommended for the player to have at a minimum:
\begin{itemize}
\item Both this corebook and a scenario book (digital copies are perfectly fine)
\item A pencil
\item A large eraser (for big mistakes)
\item 8 six-sided dice
\item A fresh pack of index cards or scratch paper
\item A bowl of coins, beads, or other small and discrete tokens
\item Printed copies of the character, status, and record sheets (and optionally the encounter quick reference sheet)
\item 3 double-sided copies of the Hexagon-Tiled Map
\item A card table or other mid-sized playing surface
\end{itemize}
What materials the player lacks can be substituted with a pencil—or a good memory, but preferably the pencil.

\subsubsection*{The Character and Status Sheets}
The character sheet is for tracking the crunchy aspects of the character, such as their statistics and equipment. It is mostly written in pencil.\\
The status sheet is used for the more dynamic and token-heavy mechanics such as the \refto{HP} slots, \refto{FP} pool, and \reftoit{sinks}.

\subsubsection*{Dice}
The player will need a large number of six-sided dice due to the game’s \reftoit{stamina pool} system. Depending on the character’s \refto{END} stat, they may need to keep six or more dice reserved for \refto{SP} dice. In addition, they will need at least two more dice for rolling on the encounter table(s).\\
If the player does not have access to this many dice, they can compensate with tokens. Cut some index cards into tokens with the number range one through six written on them, and use them to track dice scores.

\subsubsection*{The Hexagon-Tiled Map}
While it may be tempting to forgo printing physical copies of the map, it is vital for playing the game’s encounters. It’s recommended to print the map double-sided (and draw lightly) to save paper. Having some method of representing entities on the map is also necessary; the width of each hex is just enough for an American quarter-dollar or 25mm base miniature.

\subsubsection*{Index Cards}
Index cards are a versatile tool. They’re normally used for chapter cards, enemy sheets, and \reftoit{Shield Up!} tokens. But they can also be cut up to make condition tokens, or representations for entities on the Hexagon-Tiled Map.

\subsubsection*{The Record Sheet}
Occasionally, the player will be asked to take notes. They will also need to keep track of their known attunements and stash contents. This information would best be written on the record sheet, but a notepad or piece of scratch paper will also suffice.

\subsubsection*{\emph{Shield Up!} Tokens}
The player will need at least one token for simulating when an entity has their shield raised. This token needs to be large, because it will be holding damage tokens that would otherwise be assigned to the shielded entity. An index card with \reftoit{Shield Up!} written on it will suffice.

\subsubsection*{Tokens}
Tokens are primarily used for keeping track of the game’s counters such as \refto{FP}; charges for items and flasks; and damage.\\
Damage tokens are assigned to \refto{HP} slots, left unassigned on entity sheets, or deposited in \reftoit{sinks}; and this all happens frequently. Tokens will likely be the limiting reagent of the game, so the more of them the player can scrounge up the better. Coinage is very useful for tokens, since it presents an immediately familiar point worth (1 nickel = 5 pennies, for example) and cuts down on the total number of tokens in play.\\
As a last resort, the player can draw symbols or mark tallies in lieu of using tokens.

\section{Rules \& Terminology}
\subsection{General Concepts}
\subsubsection*{Dice Rolls}
All rolls are made using six-sided dice. Since this game only uses one type of die, it is abbreviated as ‘D’. If a dice roll or dice requirement is prefixed by a number, use that many six-sided dice, i.e: 2D calls for two dice.\\
Do not use a twelve-sided die instead of two six-sided dice; the probabilities would be different.\\
Sometimes the game calls for dice to be re-rolled; this is once per die and the second result is always final.

\subsubsection*{Dice Scores}
The number rolled on a die is its score. A die cannot have its score split in any way, and its score can only be committed to a single action.\\
The requirements for in-game actions may be written either in number of dice or as a flat score. If an action calls for 1D, it means one \refto{SP} die with any score. So 2D of course calls for two dice of any scores to be spent.\\
A flat number requirement, such as a 6, calls for a minimum of that total score to be spent. This can be achieved by committing either a single die that scored a 6, or by combining any number of \refto{SP} dice whose total is at least 6.\\
A plus sign designates an action that can be overspent for bonus results, i.e: a 5+ means the minimum required score is 5, but the action provides some sort of extra effect for every score spent over 5. Overspending is normally limited to double the original cost.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} If an action calls for a score of 7 or more, it will require at least two \refto{SP} dice to achieve. The difference between the game calling for 2D vs a flat 7 is:\\
1. The 2D can use any two dice regardless of their combined score.\\
2. A 2D action is a Double action. Refer to the Actions \& Reactions section for details
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection*{Learning to Play}
Because \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey} does not have a human gamemaster orchestrating it, the system’s mechanics must act as a substitute. The game cannot surprise or challenge a player if they’re in complete control of their enemies’ actions. For this reason, the encounter system is complex--and may be somewhat difficult to learn. The companion scenario--\emph{Everloyal}--contains a tutorial chapter that introduces players to the encounter system via a dripfeed of its mechanics. This companion scenario should be available wherever this corebook was found.

\subsubsection*{Rounding}
In order to minimize crunch, mechanics that involve division have their solutions rounded. The abbreviation \emph{rd} is a reminder that the score must be rounded to the nearest whole number (typically up from a .5).

\subsubsection*{Recordkeeping}
The player is asked to keep track of a large amount of information throughout a scenario. Dynamic counters such as damage and \refto{FP} are tracked via physical tokens because they are added and removed often, and constantly writing and erasing pencil marks would create an indecipherable mess. Notes and equipment, or less dynamic counters such as \refto{HMN}, are tracked via the pencil.\\
When taking a break from the game, the number and locations of tokens should be written down rather than left to the whims of pets, parents, and gusts of wind.

\subsubsection*{Scenarios and this Corebook}
This corebook should be considered a base set of rules, which are then modified by the scenario-specific ruleset. Just because an item or concept appears in this corebook does not mean it is available in every scenario. When the mechanics of the scenario and corebook differ from each other, always defer to the scenario.

\subsubsection*{Uncertainty}
If the player is ever uncertain about the specifics of a mechanic, or is flummoxed by a bizarre situation in which two mechanics disagree, they are welcome to \emph{Make Something Up}. It would be preferable if the solution wasn’t chosen by virtue of being the most beneficial to the player.

\subsection{Chapter Concepts}
\subsubsection{Chapter Exploration}
Chapters are often (but not always!) relegated to distinct geographic locations. Some chapters might proceed in a linear fashion, while others may have multiple routes or allow for freeform exploration. It’s also possible for chapters to retain special rules, such as a ticking timer or pursuant enemies. \\
What all chapters share is their CYOA format, with readings written on separate pages in non-sequitur order. When progressing through a chapter, the player must remember that their options are limited to only what is listed on the current page.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Example:} If the player drops down a cliffside and turns to a page where no option is given to climb back up, then the player cannot turn back to that previous page at the clifftop. Likewise, the character can only take a \reftoit{short reprieve} or access their stash where the chapter specifically allows for that action.
\end{tcolorbox}

When instructing the player on which reading to turn to, the scenario will use the format \emph{xx:wyz}, where \emph{xx} is the page number, and \emph{wyz} are the chapter, section, and reading (see below).

\subsubsection{Chapters, Sections, and Readings}
Each scenario is organized into a hierarchy of chapters, sections, and readings. These are serialized via codes.\\
\textbf{Example:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Take the code ‘x12’
\item The letter prepending a code, in this case ‘x’, refers its chapter
\item The first number in a code, in this case ‘1’, designates its section
\item The rest of the code is the actual reading. In this example, ‘x12’ refers to the second reading of the first section of the ‘x’ chapter
\item Notes are serialized by the reading in which they are encountered, followed by a unique letter, i.e: x12\textbf{a} in this example
\end{itemize}

\columnbreak

\subsubsection{Chapter Actions}
When reading through a chapter, a chevron (>) designates a chapter action. Chapter actions are events such as: moving to other locations, marking notes, gaining equipment, etc--all of which have some in-game effect. Chapter actions are normally optional, but chapter actions marked with double chevrons (>>) are required and \emph{must} be taken.

\subsubsection{Checks \& Gates}
Occasionally, the chapter may restrict progress or grant the player extra options based on a check. These often comes in the form of gates, where some physical portal is locked until the character acquires its key. Other times this might be a stat check, like only allowing a sufficiently intelligent character to make sense of a magical tome. A check may also reference the character’s past actions via their notes.\\

\textbf{Checks Roster:}\\
\emph{Italicized text} prefacing a chapter action designates some requirement that must be fulfilled. For example, \emph{‘8+ INT’} requires an \refto{INT} score of 8 or higher. A check might also ask for a note via its code, such as \emph{‘x12a’}, or refer to some item the character must possess.\\

\emph{AND/OR} can be used to require multiple checks for a chapter action, or at least one of them.\\

A \emph{NOT} means that the player mustn’t meet the check in order to take the subsequent chapter action--it is normally used to prevent the player from redundantly returning to previously encountered readings.\\

The above concepts are formally known as Boolean logic, and all Boolean concepts apply to them. Further information on Boolean logic can be gleaned from an internet search.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Example:}\\
>> A required action \\
> An optional action \\
> \emph{XXX:} An optional action that requires \emph{XXX}\\
>> \emph{XXX AND YYY:} An action that \emph{must} be taken if both \emph{XXX} and \emph{YYY} are fulfilled
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Finding Equipment}
Throughout a chapter’s CYOA gameplay, the character may be presented with equipment and items. This gear can only be acquired once per chapter action, even if the character makes repeated trips to the reading in which the action is available. 

\subsubsection{Mapping Progress}
While not a requirement, it may be helpful for players to keep a piece of scratch paper for mapping out their explorations.

\subsubsection{Notes and Permanent Notes}
The player is frequently asked to takes notes in service of the scenario’s CYOA gameplay. Notes are written along with a code (like \emph{x123a - Got key}) and are referenced only via this code to avoid spoilers. Most notes are erased at the end of each chapter to prevent the record sheet from becoming cluttered with information that will never be referenced again.\\
However, notes bracketed by exclamation marks (like \emph{!!x123b!! - Killed Patches}) are permanent notes, and may be referenced in other chapters. These are written in a separate section of the record sheet to prevent them from getting erased accidentally.

\subsubsection{\emph{Short Reprieves}}
\hypertarget{short reprieve}{}\hypertarget{short reprieves}{}
Occasionally, a chapter will give the player a chance to take a \reftoit{short reprieve}. This action will:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clear all damage tokens from the character’s \refto{HP} slots
\item Restore all of the character’s \refto{FP} tokens
\item Remove all \reftoit{Static} conditions, unless otherwise stated in that condition’s description
\item Refill the charges for all flasks and items that are not \reftoit{Ephemeral}
\item Repair any Broken equipment
\item Lastly, the character can use a \reftoit{short reprieve} to change attunements; upgrade their \refto{SL}; and is generally a good opportunity to take a break from the game.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Souls \& Soul Advancement}
Souls have their values marked in parentheses (the name of a soul is purely for flavor). Whenever the character obtains souls, that value is added to the total on the character sheet. \\
The character’s \refto{SL} may only be upgraded during a \reftoit{short reprieve}, and if the character is not Hollow. Whenever the character upgrades their \refto{SL}, they may increase any Primary Stat by 1 point. Immediately recalculate all Distributory Values after each \refto{SL} upgrade to ensure the full benefit of the increased stat.\\
The cost of upgrading is \emph{\refto{SL} + 1} souls, where \refto{SL} is the current value.

\subsubsection{The Stash}
\emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey’s} gameplay does not revolve around vacuuming dungeon floors. Characters should not be lugging around twenty shortswords in the hopes that they might find some pawn shop that’ll take them. However, the game has taken some precautions for to-be-used equipment. Any equipment or items the character finds can be stored in the stash, as long as that gear isn’t \reftoit{Ephemeral}. The character must have access to their stash in order to store or retrieve its contents. Note the stash’s contents on the record sheet or a piece of scratch paper. Though the default record sheet has a limited number of entries, the stash can hold unlimited items.\\
The stash has a habit of popping up now and again in odd locations, especially at sites suitable for a \reftoit{short reprieve}. How the stash makes its way from place to place with all the character’s gear is anybody’s guess.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} A \reftoit{short reprieve} does not automatically grant the character access to their stash. The scenario must state that the stash is accessible.
\end{tcolorbox}

\vfill
\pagebreak

\subsection{Encounter Concepts}
\subsubsection{Actions \& Reactions}
Up to two actions may be committed during the character’s Turn by spending \refto{SP} dice from the \reftoit{stamina pool}. Actions come in two main types: Simple and Dynamic. In addition, the \refto{SP} cost of an action might define it as a Free or Double action.\\
The character can commit either two Simple actions per Turn, or one Simple and one Dynamic. The character can perform Simple and Dynamic actions in either order.\\
In addition, the character may commit one Free action (an action with no \refto{SP} cost) per Turn. This Free action may not be committed last, and it does not count towards the character’s action minimum or action limit.\\
Actions with an \refto{SP} cost of 2D are Double actions, and count as taking both actions for the Turn. The character may still commit a Free action before a Double, but not afterwards.
\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Example:} A character might perform two Simple actions during their Turn, such as moving and then loading a crossbow.\\
They could also perform a Simple and Dynamic action in either order, such as moving and then attacking (or vice versa).\\
Or, they could perform a Double action like sprinting.\\
For their Free action, the character might switch to an alternative weapon or catalyst, but only once per Turn and not as their final action.
\end{tcolorbox}
Reactions are committed during the \emph{counterbeat}--after the active enemy’s Move (if any), but before their attack. One reaction may be committed before each and every attack, but it only takes effect for that specific attack. This is regardless of whether the character is reacting to multiple attacking enemies, or one enemy committing multiple attacks. Some attacks retain an implicit Move, which will occur after the reaction (as it is part of the attack).\\
The character may not commit a reaction if the active enemy’s Turn is listed as \reftoit{Sudden}.

\vspace*{\fill}
\columnbreak

\subsubsection{Area of Effect Attacks}
Some attacks and attunements specify areas of effect rather than targets. Area of effect attacks can always strike concealment or out-of-range tiles, but at least one impact tile must be visible and within range.\\

\textbf{Examples}:
\begin{center}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{misc/aoes_1.png}}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{misc/aoes_2.png}}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{misc/aoes_3.png}}
\end{center}
Expand these examples in a logical fashion for similar patterns such as 3-hex cones or 5-hex waves. Cones expand outwards another hex for each additional range, while waves always remain three-across.\\
Enemies with complex attack patterns should have visual examples included in their enemy sheet.\\

\pagebreak

Area of effect attacks are blocked by full-cover tiles. When an area of effect attack passes by a full-cover tile, it may not ‘curve’ to reach tiles behind the obstacle.\\
\textbf{Example:}
\begin{center}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{misc/aoe_valid.png}}
\emph{Black tiles are full-cover obstacles. Red tiles are valid targets. White tiles are invalid.}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Casting Power (PWR)}
\hypertarget{PWR}{}
The \refto{PWR} of an attunement is the combination of the caster’s bonus for that attunement type, and the Power of their catalyst. It alters the effects of an attunement in various ways, such as damage or range.

\subsubsection{Conditions}
All conditions are cumulative unless stated otherwise, meaning an entity can be afflicted with multiple tokens for the same condition. Some conditions may be mitigated via \reftoit{sinks}. Conditions come in three types: \emph{Immediate}, \emph{Time-Limited}, and \emph{Static.}\\

\emph{\textbf{Immediate}} conditions have some instant effect on the afflicted. They do not require a token for recordkeeping, unless they’re being \reftoit{sunk}.\\

\emph{\textbf{Time-Limited}} conditions take effect for as long as at least one token is present on the afflicted’s entity sheet. One \emph{Time-Limited - Turn} token is removed from an entity’s sheet after every Turn. One \emph{Time-Limited - Round} token is removed from all entity sheets at the end of each Round.\\

\emph{\textbf{Static}}\hypertarget{Static}{} conditions take effect for as long as at least one token is present on the afflicted’s entity sheet. These tokens can only be removed by committing certain actions or fulfilling special conditions.

Lastly, some conditions such as Burning and Bleeding produce damage tokens. However, these damage tokens can also be inflicted by attacks that do not inflict their parent condition.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Example:} The Bleeding condition produces Bleed damage tokens. A whip also inflicts Bleed damage, but does not inflict the Bleeding condition proper.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Conditions Roster}
\textbf{Blazing:} \emph{Static.} At the beginning of each Turn, the entity receives 1 \reftoit{Unblockable} Burn damage token. Assign this damage as normal (it may be \reftoit{sunk} this Turn).\\
The Blazing token can only be removed via committing the \emph{Roll!} action, or entering certain special tiles.\\
Blazing is a non-cumulative condition; an entity can only be afflicted by 1 Blazing token at a time.\\
Blazing entities do not benefit from concealment, including the effects of darkness.\\

\textbf{Bleeding:} \emph{Static.} At the beginning of the each Turn, the entity receives 1 Bleed damage token. Assign this damage as normal (it may be \reftoit{sunk} this Turn).\\
Bleeding is a cumulative condition, but an entity can only be afflicted by a maximum of 3 Bleeding tokens at a time.\\
Bleeding can only be removed via items and some attunements.\\

\textbf{Blinded:} \emph{Time-Limited - Turn.} The afflicted entity cannot commit attacks, and will not skirt around hazard tiles. This condition is non-cumulative.\\

\textbf{Broken:} \emph{Static.} Place a Broken token on the afflicted piece of equipment. This equipment provides no effects, and can’t be used. Broken tokens are only removed from equipment during a \reftoit{short reprieve} (or if the equipment regains a Durability \reftoit{sink}). All pieces of equipment including rings and missiles can be broken, but not flasks or miscellaneous items.\\

\textbf{Charmed:} \emph{Time-Limited - Turn.} After the encounter roll, but before the \emph{counterbeat} or any reactions are resolved, the player may make moves and attacks for any Charmed entities. The entity is limited to a Move action and one of its listed attack actions, and it will not obey any encounter roll during a Turn where it is Charmed. Encounter rolls should be made and exhausted regardless.\\

\textbf{\emph{Cursed!:}} \emph{Static.} The character is immediately defeated. The character loses all \refto{HMN}, becomes Hollow, and cannot increase \refto{HMN} or upgrade \refto{SL} while \emph{Cursed!} This condition can only be removed via a secret method.\\

\textbf{Dismounted:} \emph{Static.} A \emph{Mounted} type entity is pulled from their mount. Refer to the entity sheet for details on what this condition entails. This condition is usually permanent.\\

\textbf{Disoriented:} \emph{Instant.} Reduces the character’s \refto{FP} by the specified amount. This condition can be \reftoit{sunk} using \refto{RES} (per Disoriented token, not per \refto{FP} lost).\\

\textbf{Drain:} \emph{Instant.} Drain restores the enemy’s \refto{HP} by the specified amount if its attack assigns any damage tokens to \refto{HP} slots. \\

\textbf{Fear:} \emph{Time-Limited - Turn.} This entity will not move towards the character or attempt attacks with melee weapons. If within 2 tiles of the character at the start of their Turn, an enemy afflicted by Fear will use half their Move value \emph{rd} to move away from the character.\\

\textbf{Flinch:} \emph{Immediate.} The character loses 1 \refto{SP} die with the highest score from their \reftoit{stamina pool}.\\
This condition can be \reftoit{sunk} using \refto{PS}.\\

\textbf{Frozen:} \emph{Static.} Remove Blazing and \reftoit{Shield Up!} The afflicted entity cannot commit to any action except \reftoit{Struggle!} while Frozen, but gains 1 \refto{P.DEF} per Frozen token.\\
Each use of the \reftoit{Struggle!} action removes 1 Frozen token. During a \emph{counterbeat}, any enemy incapable of resolving its encounter roll due to being Frozen will instead perform the \reftoit{Struggle!} action.\\
Suffering Burn damage will also remove 1 Frozen token per Burn damage.\\

\textbf{Grappled/Eaten:} \emph{Static.} Functions the same as Netted/Webbed, except the character takes routine damage specified by the attack.\\

\textbf{Hollow:} \emph{Static.} Designates a character that was defeated while having 0 \refto{HMN}. This character cannot upgrade \refto{SL}. This condition is only removed once the character gains \refto{HMN}. In addition, it may affect some chapter options.\\
Gaining \refto{HMN} while Hollow only removes the condition, the character will still be at 0 \refto{HMN} and may hollow again if defeated.\\

\textbf{Knockback:} \emph{Immediate.} The afflicted entity is moved directly backwards from the source of the Knockback by the specified number of hexes.\\
If the afflicted entity is moved onto a hazard tile in this manner, end the Knockback and resolve the effects of the hazard tile.\\
If Knockback attempts to move the entity into an impassable tile, they instead suffer 1 \emph{Unblockable} Crush damage per Knockback remaining. If the entity receives more than 1 Crush damage in this way, then they are also inflicted with Knockdown.\\
If the Knockback moves an entity into another entity, then that secondary entity receives the aforementioned Crush damage and Knockdown instead.\\
This condition can be \reftoit{sunk} using \refto{PS} (at 1 tile per \refto{PS} value).

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Example:} If an entity suffers Knockback 3 but was adjacent to an impassable tile, then 3 Crush damage is dealt along with Knockdown.\\
If the entity suffered Knockback 3, and was moved 2 tiles before striking an impassable tile, then it would suffer 1 Crush damage but not Knockdown.
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Knockdown:} \emph{Static.} Remove any \reftoit{Shield Up!} token from the afflicted. While knocked down, an entity’s actions are limited to those specifying that they may be committed while knocked down.\\
Any adjacent half-cover obstacles are treated as full-cover while knocked down.\\
During a \emph{counterbeat}, any enemy incapable of resolving its encounter roll due to being knocked down will instead perform the \emph{Get Up!} action.\\
Knocked down entities still occupy their tile(s), but may be crossed over by other entities making a Move action.\\
This condition is non-cumulative, and can be \reftoit{sunk} using \refto{PS}.

\textbf{Maddened:} \emph{Time-Limited - Turn.} A Maddened entity will target the nearest entity during its Turn, friend or foe. If multiple entities are equidistant, the character always takes priority, but otherwise it’s the player’s choice.\\

\textbf{Mute:} \emph{Time-Limited - Round.} A Mute entity cannot use any attunements except for Guts.\\

\textbf{Netted/Webbed}: \emph{Static.} The afflicted entity cannot Move, or use any actions’ implicit movement. All actions besides \emph{Struggle!} cost +1 \refto{SP} per Netted/Webbed token.\\
Each use of the \reftoit{Struggle!} action removes 1 Netted/Webbed token.\\
During a \emph{counterbeat}, any enemy incapable of resolving its encounter roll due to being Netted/Webbed will instead perform the \reftoit{Struggle!} action.\\

\textbf{Sapped:} \emph{Time-Limited - Round.} The afflicted character rolls 1 less \refto{SP} die per Sapped token on their character sheet.\\

\textbf{Slowed:} \emph{Time-Limited - Turn.} All movement taken by this entity has its Move value reduced to Move/2 \emph{rd} to a minimum of 1. This condition is non-cumulative.\\

\textbf{Staggered:} \emph{Time Limited - Turn.} The character can only perform 1 action (Simple or Dynamic) during their \emph{beat} while Staggered.\\
This condition can be \reftoit{sunk} using \refto{RES}.\\

\textbf{Stunned:} \emph{Time-Limited - Turn.} Remove \reftoit{Shield Up!} The afflicted entity may not commit to any actions or reactions while Stunned.\\
A Stunned character with no \refto{SP} dice remaining will still end the Round and re-roll their \reftoit{stamina pool}, and will begin the next Round afflicted by this condition.\\
This condition is non-cumulative.\\

\textbf{Withering:} \emph{Time-Limited - Round.} Withering tokens can use \refto{D.DEF} as a \reftoit{sink}. If the status sheet contains 3 Withering tokens outside of the \refto{D.DEF} \reftoit{sink} at any time, immediately remove all Withering tokens from the status sheet and afflict the character with the \emph{Cursed!} condition.

\subsubsection{Damage}
Most incoming damage tokens are immediately assigned to \refto{HP} slots unless they’re mitigated through \reftoit{Shield Up!}, a \reftoit{sink}, or reactions such as \reftoit{Dodge!} Refer to those mechanic’s sections for details.\\
Some damage types, such as Poison, accumulate on the entity sheet and trickle into \refto{HP} slots each Turn. This often gives the entity the chance to address these tokens before they’re assigned, i.e: drinking an antidote to remove unassigned Poison tokens.\\
When all of an entity’s \refto{HP} slots are filled with tokens, it is defeated and removed from the encounter.

\subsubsection{Damage Modifiers Roster}
Incoming damage can be modified to prevent some or all types of mitigation.\\

\textbf{\emph{High:}} A \makerefit{High} attack cannot hit entities that are knocked down.\\

\textbf{\emph{Inevitable:}} \makerefit{Inevitable} refers to attacks that cannot be mitigated through any means: \reftoit{sinks}, \emph{Dodge!}, blocking, or parrying. This damage is assigned directly to \refto{HP} slots.\\

\textbf{\emph{Magical:}} \makerefit{Magical} refers to physical attacks that have been modified with magic. They can only use the \refto{M.DEF} \reftoit{sink}, but can still be placed on \reftoit{Shield Up!} tokens.\\

\textbf{\emph{Unblockable:}} \makerefit{Unblockable} refers to attacks whose damage tokens cannot be placed on a \reftoit{Shield Up!} token. This does not prevent them from being assigned to \reftoit{sinks}.\\

\textbf{\emph{Undodgeable:}} \makerefit{Undodgeable} refers to attacks that cannot be mitigated via the \reftoit{Dodge!} action.\\

\textbf{\emph{Unparryable:}} \makerefit{Unparryable} attacks cannot be mitigated through Parry or Parry-like reactions. It usually refers to ‘natural’ attacks, such as bites and claws.\\

\textbf{\emph{Unsinkable:}} \makerefit{Unsinkable} refers to damage tokens that cannot be encapsulated by a \reftoit{sink}. This does not prevent them from being assigned to a \reftoit{Shield Up!} token.

\subsubsection{Damage Types Roster}
\textbf{Acid/Breaking:} For all Acid tokens dealt to the character in a single attack, at least 1 such token must be assigned to an available Durability \reftoit{sink}. The player may assign all Acid tokens to Durability \reftoit{sinks} in this manner. If there are no Durability \reftoit{sinks} available, then at least 1 Acid token must be used to afflict a currently equipped piece of gear with the Broken condition.\\
Acid tokens that are not assigned to Durability \reftoit{sinks}, or do not break equipment, are assigned to \refto{HP} slots as normal.\\
Breaking damage functions the same as Acid, except it can never be assigned to \refto{HP} slots.\\
For enemies, Acid/Breaking will permanently reduce their \refto{P.DEF}, or their shield’s Durability if the damage is assigned to \reftoit{Shield Up!}\\

\textbf{Bleed:} Bleed damage is always \reftoit{Unblockable}, and can only use \refto{RES} as a \reftoit{sink}.\\
Bleed tokens assigned to \refto{HP} slots are cleared after the end of an encounter.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} Use some method to distinguish Bleed tokens, such as a differently colored token or flipping the coin upside down, as a reminder to remove them after the encounter.
\end{tcolorbox}
\ \\
\textbf{Burn:} Burn damage can only use \refto{F.DEF} as a \reftoit{sink}.\\

\textbf{Dark:} Dark damage can only use \refto{D.DEF} as a \reftoit{sink}.\\

\textbf{Magic:} Magic damage can only use \refto{M.DEF} as a \reftoit{sink}. This includes any Slash, Crush, or Pierce attacks that have been modified to become \reftoit{Magical}.\\

\textbf{Physical}: These three types of damage—Slash, Crush, and Pierce—are all considered Physical damage.\\
A weapon’s damage type(s) determines what sort of attacks can be committed, i.e: a blunt weapon such as a mace cannot commit slashing or piercing attacks.\\
Some enemies may have resistance against specific types of Physical damage.\\
All three Physical damage types can use \refto{P.DEF} as a \reftoit{sink}.

\columnbreak

\textbf{Poison:} Poison damage can only use \refto{RES} as a \reftoit{sink}. Poison tokens are never immediately assigned to \refto{HP} slots. While an entity sheet contains unassigned Poison tokens, assign 1 such Poison token to an \refto{HP} slot at the beginning of their Turn.\\

\textbf{Smite:} Smite damage can only use \refto{L.DEF} as a \reftoit{sink}.\\

\textbf{Toxic:} Toxic damage can only use \refto{RES} as a \reftoit{sink}. Toxic tokens are never immediately assigned to \refto{HP} slots. While an entity sheet contains unassigned Toxic tokens, assign 2 such Toxin tokens to \refto{HP} slots at the beginning of their Turn.

\subsubsection{Darkness}
In dark encounters, all tiles past range 2 are concealment. With a lit light source, this range is expanded to 5 tiles, but the light-holding entity is not concealed.

\subsubsection{\emph{Dodge!}}
\hypertarget{Dodge!}{}
\reftoit{Dodge!} is a reaction the character may commit to evade most kinds of attacks. Its \refto{SP} cost and implicit Move will change depending on the character’s \refto{ENC}. Characters that have far exceeded their weight capacity will be incapable of committing the reaction. See the Dynamic Actions Roster entry for details.

\subsubsection{\emph{Guard Break}}
\hypertarget{Guard Break}{}
Shields can block a limited number of damage tokens per Round, determined by the shield’s Stability stat. When a shield blocks an additional token past its Stability, the entity loses \reftoit{Shield Up!} and suffers Stun, Flinch, and 1 Breaking damage on the shield. Any extra Stability damage past the token that caused \reftoit{Guard Break} will ‘bleed over’ to \refto{HP} (it may still be \reftoit{sunk}).\\
After suffering \reftoit{Guard Break}, the shield cannot be used again until its Stability is restored.

\subsubsection{Light Sources}
Light sources can either come from equipment or attunements. To benefit from an equipped light source, that light source must be currently held and lit.\\
Unequipping a light source during an encounter will usually douse it (it must be lit again).

\subsubsection{Known Attunements}
When the character encounters a new attunement, it is recorded in the ‘Known Attunements’ section of their record sheet regardless of whether they meet its requirements.\\
Although the default record sheet has a limited number of entries, the character can know an unlimited number of attunements.\\
The character must take a \reftoit{short reprieve} in order to swap out attunements from their \refto{POTs}.

\subsubsection{\emph{Lock-On}}
\hypertarget{Lock-On}{}
Ranged attacks with \reftoit{Lock-On} can maneuver towards the target via whatever route they find necessary.\\
\reftoit{Lock-On} attacks can also target enemies in concealment, and ignore \reftoit{Dodge!}

\subsubsection{Movement}
Move values are given as a flat number. The entity may move up to that maximum number of tiles.\\
A ‘!’ designates some implicit movement that must be taken, such as the Move for \emph{Dodge!}\\
A hyphenated value such as 1-2 also designates some minimum necessary movement for an action.

\subsubsection{Overspent Actions}
When a \refto{SP} or \refto{FP} cost is appended by a ‘+’ sign, it can be overspent up to double its original cost.\\
\emph{The player may not ‘burn dice’ by overspending them on an action past its maximum cost.}

\subsubsection{Ranged Attacks}
Ranged attacks such as bows, crossbows, or thrown items cannot be mitigated through Parry.\\
Ranged melee refers to melee attacks that occur at range, such as spear thrusts. Although these attacks must obey ranged targeting rules, they are still melee and may be mitigated through Parry.\\
Attack ranges are given as flat numbers representing the attack’s maximum distance in tiles. For ranges with hyphenated numbers, such as 2-3, the first number represents the attack’s minimum range.\\
Ranged melee attacks and ranged attacks without \reftoit{Lock-On} cannot target tiles in or past concealment, but may still strike concealed tiles via any area of effect. They also cannot curve around full-cover obstacles or entities. When plotting the route for these attacks, there must be a direct line of sight from attacker to target regardless of number of tiles traveled.\\
To check difficult calls, simply place a pencil or other straight-edged object from the center of the attacker to the center of the target tile. If the straight-edge does not cross through a tile containing an entity or full-cover, then the attack is valid.\\
The attack is only blocked if it were to pass through two separate edges of the occupied tile; simply skirting an edge will not invalidate the attack.\\

\textbf{Ranged Attack Example:}
\begin{center}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{misc/ranged_invalid.png}\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{misc/ranged_valid.png}}\ \\
\emph{The tails-up dime (left example) is an invalid target, as the heads-up dime is in the way. The penny (right example) would be a valid target for a ranged attack.}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Rounds \& Turns}
A Round refers to a break in the encounter that occurs when the character re-rolls their \reftoit{stamina pool}. This event is also used for other mechanics, such as \emph{doom events} and some conditions.\\
A Turn refers to a \emph{beat} or \emph{counterbeat}. When this corebook uses Turn in a possessive sense (i.e: the character’s Turn), it is referring to either the character’s \emph{beat} or the enemy’s \emph{counterbeat.}

\subsubsection{\emph{Shield Up!}}
\hypertarget{Shield Up!}{}
Shields are used by committing the \reftoit{Shield Up!} action, which adds a \reftoit{Shield Up!} token to the entity sheet. While \reftoit{Shield Up!} is present, the shielded entity places all incoming damage on this token--up to the shield’s Defense value per attack. The entity may not elect to forgo blocking any attacks in this manner. Damage tokens that are listed as \reftoit{Unblockable} or \reftoit{Inevitable} cannot be placed on the \reftoit{Shield Up!} token.\\
If the number of damage tokens on a \reftoit{Shield Up!} token ever exceeds the shield’s Stability, that entity will suffer an immediate \reftoit{Guard Break.}\\
If knocked down, the entity can still add a \reftoit{Shield Up!} token to their entity sheet, and it will not be removed by performing the \emph{Get Up!} action.\\
If a shielded entity commits any action, remove the \reftoit{Shield Up!} token unless instructed otherwise.\\
Remove all damage tokens from \reftoit{Shield Up!} at the start of every Round.\\
Unequipping a shield or committing Lower Shield will not immediately clear it of damage tokens.

\subsubsection{\emph{Sinks}}
\hypertarget{sink}{}\hypertarget{sunk}{}\hypertarget{sinks}{}\hypertarget{Sinks}{}
\reftoit{Sinks} refers to the mechanic by which entities can avoid assigning damage to \refto{HP} slots or suffering certain conditions.\\
\reftoit{Sinks} include: \refto{P.DEF}, \refto{F.DEF}, \refto{M.DEF}, \refto{D.DEF}, \refto{L.DEF}, \refto{RES}, and \refto{PS}. These Defenses refer to which specific damage and/or condition tokens they can \reftoit{sink}. See ‘Defenses’ in the Player Character section for details.\\
\reftoit{Sinks} can encapsulate a total number of damage and/or condition tokens equal to their value. They can encapsulate both incoming damage and conditions, as well as trickling damage tokens, but not conditions that were already present on the entity sheet.\\
All \reftoit{sinks} are cleared of their damage tokens at the start of each Round.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} Remember that \reftoit{sinks} and \reftoit{Shield Up!} are cleared during the start of the Round, not each Turn.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Special Tiles}
Some encounters may designate tiles as half or full-cover, concealment, hazards, or retreat tiles. The player should use distinct methods for designating these special tiles, such as different symbols or colors. The encounter should designate the exact location of each special tile in \emph{X,Y} format, preferably along with a diagram.

\subsubsection{Special Tiles Roster}
\textbf{Cover:} Cover refers to solid tiles, such as a wall or fallen tree, which cannot be occupied or moved through normally.\\
Half-cover tiles can have missiles and spells shot over them (as well as ranged melee attacks), while full-cover tiles are completely obstructed and even block AoE attacks.\\

\textbf{Concealment:} Concealment refers to a tile which blocks line of sight, ranged attacks, and ranged melee attacks. Exceptions to this include: area of effect attacks, which may reach into concealment; and ranged attacks with \emph{Lock-On}. An entity may still attack into an adjacent concealment tile in melee.\\
Concealment tiles can be occupied, and the tile’s occupant can see clearly outwards.\\
Enemies will still move towards a concealed character, unless otherwise specified by the encounter.\\
A \emph{Large} enemy whose body occupies multiple hexes cannot conceal itself in a single concealment hex. \\

\textbf{Hazards:} Hazard tiles designate terrain like pitfalls or lakes of lava. Not all hazard tiles are dangerous. Some may simply slow down movement, such as knee-deep water or rough terrain. Some hazards may even be beneficial to its occupants. Refer to the encounter’s rules for the effects of entering these tiles.\\
A hazard tile’s effects are resolved immediately after an entity moves onto the tile.\\

\textbf{Retreat:} Retreat tiles are hexes from which the character may Retreat from the encounter. The character can commit the Retreat action from a retreat tile on any \emph{beat} where they are capable of making a Move action. Refer to the encounter’s instructions for resolving a retreat.\\
Not all encounters will contain retreat tiles.

\subsubsection{\emph{Stamina Pool}}
\hypertarget{stamina pool}{}
The character commits actions and reactions during an encounter by spending \refto{SP} dice from their \reftoit{stamina pool}. The number of \refto{SP} dice available is determined by the character’s \refto{END} stat.

\subsubsection{Straight or Snaking}
Straight or snaking refers to possible routes for line-type area of effects, or the directions an entity might move while making a charging-type attack.\\
Here is a visual example of straight and snaking patterns for a range 3 attack:
\begin{center}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{misc/straight_snaking.png}}
\end{center}
Snaking can of course snake either left or right. And a snaking pattern may ‘curve’ around obstacles and entities as long as it keeps its original pattern intact.\\
For charging-type attacks, the attack must be angled in the direction of the \emph{last performed} Move, or one hex left or right of that direction. To clarify: an entity cannot charge one way and then attack in the opposite direction of their charge.

\subsubsection{\emph{Sudden}}
\hypertarget{Sudden}{}
A \reftoit{Sudden} \emph{counterbeat} does not give the character the opportunity to commit a reaction.

\subsubsection{Trickling Damage}
Damage that is not assigned to an \refto{HP} slot, deposited in a \reftoit{sink}, or placed on a \reftoit{Shield Up!} token is considered unassigned damage.\\
Trickling damage such as Poison or Toxic is left unassigned at first, and then assigned one or two tokens at a time at the start of every Turn.

\subsubsection{Two vs. One-Handing}
Most weapons can either be held in a single hand, or two-handed. The exception to this is ranged weapons like bows, and some special or large weapons.\\
The primary difference between these two options is that Light Attacks must be committed one-handed, while Heavy Attacks must be committed two-handed. Both of these attack types have their advantages and use cases. In addition, one-handing a weapon allows the character to use a shield, dual wield, or keep a free hand for using items.\\
Characters can use their Turn’s Free action to swap their hand slots, but not as their final action for the Turn.\\
Weapons that are implicitly one-handed will never reach parity with two-handed weapons in terms of Heavy Attack damage output, as implicitly two-handed weapons are given an additional point of base damage. However, two-handed weapons such as large swords have strict \refto{STR} requirements to be one-handed--and some two-handed melee weapons cannot be one-handed at all.

\subsubsection{Victory, Defeat, and Retreat}
After combat, refer to the encounter page. It will have specific instructions for whether the player won, retreated, or was defeated in the encounter. All conditions, even \emph{Static} ones, are removed at the end of an encounter, as is any unassigned damage.\\

\textbf{Victory:} Victory will usually reward the character with souls and perhaps some item or extra progression option. Neither \refto{HP} nor \refto{FP} are restored after an encounter, except for assigned Bleed tokens which are removed from their \refto{HP} slots.\\

\textbf{Defeat:} Defeat will often reduce the character’s \refto{HMN}, erase their unspent souls, or rob them of their \reftoit{carried} items. Refer to the specific instructions for defeat during the encounter.\\
Some encounters can be repeated upon defeat. Other encounters might shunt the player into an alternative chapter route. Regardless, no scenario should be dependent on winning each and every encounter.\\

\textbf{Retreat:} In the event that victory seems unlikely, retreating is always encouraged when possible. If the character is located on a retreat tile during the \emph{beat}, and is not prevented from making a Move action; the player may elect to Retreat from the encounter as an action.

\vfill
\pagebreak

\subsection{Entity Concepts}
Both the character and enemies are referred to as ‘entities’. Entities is also the term used when a gameplay concept applies equally to both parties. Likewise, entity sheet refers to both status and enemy sheets.\\
If a mechanic is specific to either the character or enemies, then that particular party will be named directly.

\subsubsection{Enemy Sheets}
Each enemy will need a miniature status sheet for itself: its enemy sheet. Index cards or scratch paper are useful for this purpose. Write any important stats such as Move on them for quick reference.\\
Draw a circle on the sheet for any \reftoit{sinks}. Also draw an \refto{HP} circle and write the \refto{HP} value in it (instead of drawing multiple slots). \\
When an encounter involves multiple identical enemies, there’s no need to write all of their information repeatedly. Just reproduce the \refto{HP} circle and any \reftoit{sinks}. Number the sheets and tokens, or use any other method, to keep track of who’s who.

\subsubsection{Enemy Types}
Enemies may have special types applied to them, such as \emph{Undead} or \emph{Intelligent}, which can give them special rules or make them obey certain mechanics. These rules should be explained in the scenario book and/or enemy description. A few of the default types are listed here.

\subsubsection*{Enemy Types Roster}
\textbf{Alert:} This entity is immune to the Backstab attack.\\

\textbf{Amphibious:} This entity ignores the normal effects of water tiles.\\

\textbf{Aquatic:} This entity ignores the normal effects of water tiles, and can only occupy tiles that are water.\\

\textbf{Floating/Flying:} This entity ignores hazard tiles and half-cover obstacles unless afflicted with Knockdown.\\

\textbf{Formation Fighter:} This entity is a formation of individual entities, and retains its own specific ruleset dictating their movement and attacks. Entities in a formation act during a single Turn, are immune to Knockback and Knockdown, and can attack freely past each other.\\

\textbf{Great Foe:} In other words, a boss. This entity ignores all conditions inflicted by normal sources, except Blazing and Bleeding, and is immune to Backstab.\\

\textbf{Hollowed:} This entity is insane and ignores the Stunned, Charmed, Maddened, and Fear conditions.\\

\textbf{Intelligent:} This entity is either human or possesses a human-like intelligence. If the shortest route for an \emph{Intelligent} enemy’s movement would cause it to bunch up with other entities or otherwise not reach its intended target, it will take another, longer route to its target. \emph{Intelligent} enemies will also \emph{Drop!} and \emph{Roll!} away from the character if they are Blazing at the start of their \emph{counterbeat.}\\

\textbf{Large:} This entity occupies 2 tiles (head and tail) and ignores normal Knockback and Knockdown sources. For the purposes of movement, the head tile is always moved first and the tail tile is filled-in behind the head, opposite its movement or attack direction. Turning (i.e: just moving the tail) will still use a point of Move.\\
There are some attacks that specifically originate from the head or tail, and use that tile to determine range. If an attack does not specify a head or tail tile, then it may originate from either.\\
If using coinage for entity tokens, the head and tail tile can easily be distinguished using those selfsame sides of the coins.\\

\textbf{Mounted:} This enemy rides something, and can be subjected to the Dismounted condition. The actual effect of being Dismounted is specific to each enemy.\\

\textbf{Undead:} This entity is \emph{Undead}, and is subject to certain attacks or effects that only affect the \emph{Undead.} Unless stated otherwise in the enemy’s description, an \emph{Undead} enemy is not affected by Bleed or Dark damage, nor subject to the Stunned, Charmed, Bleeding, Maddened, or Fear conditions.\\

This is only a small selection of enemy types.

\subsubsection{Resolving Enemy Behavior}
Because \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey} does not have a human gamemaster, a large part of the system is dedicated to determining enemy behavior. When determining how an enemy behaves during its Turn, adhere to the following guidelines:\\

\textbf{1 -- The Encounter Roll:} First, the player will roll on the encounter table.\\
If there are multiple encounter tables, resolve each encounter roll for all its controlled entities before rolling on the next table. Resolve the encounter tables in alphabetical order.\\

\textbf{2 -- Conditional Behavior:} Some encounter rolls will provide conditional behavior for the active enemy. This allows enemies to perform alternative maneuvers when they can’t resolve an attack.\\
Conditional behavior only hinges on whether the enemy can resolve the behavior’s \emph{very first} attack, not whether that attack will actually damage its target.\\
An encounter roll’s conditional behaviors are resolved in alphabetical order (\textbf{A}, \textbf{B}, \textbf{C}, etc). The last listed behavior is resolved even if the enemy cannot land its attack. It is considered the ‘default behavior’.\\

\textbf{3 -- Move:} Enemies cannot use their Move value unless the encounter roll specifically calls for it. Enemies will normally move up to their maximum Move value towards the character, using the shortest logical route to the nearest free hex.\\
Some enemies may prefer to keep their distance from the character, which will be clearly dictated on their enemy sheet, i.e: ‘keeps 1 tile distance’. These enemies will also Move away from the character to maintain their preferred distance.\\
Enemies will normally skirt hazard tiles during movement, unless they are Blinded or the hazard tile is non-lethal (i.e: knee-deep water).\\
If an enemy cannot reach the character, or there are no free adjacent tiles, it should move as close as possible using the shortest logical route, even if it needs to bunch up behind other entities.\\ 
Entities cannot Move through tiles containing other entities, unless they’re afflicted with Knockdown.\\
Lastly, an enemy’s Move is cognizant of the range for their \emph{first listed} attack. This means that enemies making ranged attacks will Move to shoot across hazards instead of skirting around them.\\

\textbf{4 -- Attacking:} Refer to the enemy’s listed attacks for details on damage, modifiers, type, range, and any implicit Move.\\
If an enemy is out of range for an attack due to the character committing a reaction (such as Juke or \reftoit{Dodge!}), then the entity shall be treated as if it committed the attack anyway.\\
Some attacks give the enemy an implicit Move. This Move is always taken by the active enemy, even if their attack does not land. If an enemy commits multiple attacks with implicit Move, it gets to use each implicit Move before every attack.\\

\textbf{5 -- Special Conditions:} Some enemies have special reactions to conditions like being knocked down. Refer to the enemy’s description page. This special behavior will be listed with the enemy’s other types, if any.\\

The result of this system is that enemy behavior is semi-predictable. The player can look at an encounter table and determine what exact behaviors their enemy might resolve (and tailor their Turn accordingly). However, the actual behavior of the enemy is still left to chance.

\vfill

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} Lastly, this system was designed cognizant of the fact that the player will be controlling their own opponents, and that the player will encounter situations where they can make decisions for their opponents that are beneficial to their character. This is perfectly fine, \emph{so long as those moves are legal and sensible}. Controlling enemies is as much a part of the game’s strategy as controlling the character--in fact, some encounters might be based around it!
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Equipment \& Attunement\newline Concepts}

\subsubsection{Attunements}
Attunements are spells and abilities that cost \refto{FP} tokens to use. Each attunement must be equipped in a number of \refto{POTs} equal to its Intensity. The character always has access to all of their known attunements during a \reftoit{short reprieve}. Using an attunement during a \reftoit{short reprieve} will still cost \refto{FP} tokens that cannot be restored during that same \reftoit{short reprieve}.\\
Attunements can only be re-assigned during a \reftoit{short reprieve}.\\
The method for learning attunements depends on the scenario, but is usually done through interacting with events or non-player characters.

\subsubsection{Broken Equipment}
Broken equipment is no longer usable. This includes whatever bonuses or special effects that equipment normally allows. Broken weapons cannot attack, broken shields cannot use \reftoit{Shield Up!}, broken rings provide no boons, broken catalysts cannot Cast, and so on and so forth. This equipment can be repaired during a \emph{short reprieve.}

\subsubsection{Catalysts}
In order to activate an attunement, the caster must equip a catalyst that allows for that attunement type. This catalyst’s Power assists in determining the quality of that sorcery, hex, miracle, or pyromancy. Guts-type attunements do not require a catalyst.

\subsubsection{\emph{Carried}}
\hypertarget{Carried}{}\hypertarget{carried}{}\hypertarget{carry}{}
The character can \reftoit{carry} additional items and pieces of equipment, but cannot access them during an encounter. They’re assumed to be kept in a pack, or stuffed under an armpit, or something. \reftoit{Carried} items are noted on the record sheet.\\
While the character cannot access \reftoit{carried} slots during an encounter, they can freely swap equipment or even use items during chapter exploration.\\
This system was not designed to incentivize hoarding equipment. The \reftoit{carried} mechanic is intended for hauling to-be-used gear for the stash, or holding onto some items for use outside of encounters. For this reason, the character is limited to 8 \reftoit{carried} slots.\\
\reftoit{Carried} items do not contribute to a character’s \refto{ENC} value.\\
Attunements do not occupy \reftoit{carried} slots. Attunements are knowledge, and are instead written in the ‘Known Attunements’ section of the record sheet.\\
Some items, such as important keys, are written as notes and do not need to be \reftoit{carried}.

\subsubsection{Defense (Armor \& Outfits)}
Armor’s primary purpose is to increase the size of the \refto{P.DEF} \reftoit{sink} by its Defense stat, in order to encapsulate more Physical damage tokens per Round. Some armor may also increase the size of other \emph{sinks.}\\
(See the \reftoit{Shield Up!} section for shield Defense)

\subsubsection{Dual Wielding}
A weapon wielded in the off-hand has all of its weapon scaling grades reduced by one full letter. Flip one hand token upside down to represent the off-hand.

\subsubsection{Durability}
Some equipment has Durability \reftoit{sinks} which can be used to mitigate damage like Acid/Breaking. If equipment has no Durability remaining, and takes Acid/Breaking damage, it becomes Broken.

\subsubsection{\emph{Ephemeral}}
\hypertarget{Ephemeral}{}
\reftoit{Ephemeral} equipment is deleted from the character sheet at the end of the chapter in which it’s found. In addition, \reftoit{Ephemeral} items never regain their charges.

\subsubsection{Flasks}
Flasks are equipped in pouches like any other item. Flasks produce effects when the character drinks from them. However, drinking necessitates proper situational awareness, as it is a Double action. Drinking from a flask reduces its charges by 1.

\subsubsection{Free Hand}
Leaving a free hand open alters the Use Item \refto{SP} cost to 2, and Drink to a flat 5. In addition, the character can still use their free fist as a weapon. Remove one hand token to represent free handing.

\subsubsection{Hand Slots}
The character has four hand slots for equipping weapons, shields, and catalysts. Use two tokens (representing the character’s two hands) to track what’s being equipped in either hand. The passive effects (and weight) of equipment in hand slots is always in-play, regardless of whether or not that equipment is actually equipped.

\subsubsection{Items}
Miscellaneous items are equipped in pouches, and used via the Use Item action. When an item is used, reduce its charges (if any) by 1. Items’ charges are refilled during \reftoit{short reprieves}, unless they are \reftoit{Ephemeral}. If an \reftoit{Ephemeral} item loses its charges, immediately erase it from the character sheet (including its weight).\\
If the character has multiple items of the same type, they must be equipped in separate pouches. They cannot have their charges combined.\\
Items can only be used during an encounter if they are equipped in a pouch, but \reftoit{carried} items can be used freely outside of encounters.\\
To mark charges, either keep tokens on the character sheet or add tokens as charges are used; whichever method feels right.

\subsubsection{Missiles}
Missiles must be equipped in a quiver in order to be utilized by ranged weaponry. A quiver is an item that takes up a pouch slot.\\
While \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey} is stern, it is not meant to be cruel. There are no ammunition limits for missiles. However, some ranged weaponry such as crossbows must be loaded by committing an action.\\
Thrown weapons such as javelins or throwing knives are not listed as ranged weapons or missiles, but are equipped in pouches as consumable items.

\subsubsection{One-Handing Two-Handed Weapons}
A two-handed weapon can be wielded in one hand if the character has double the \refto{STR} requirement.

\subsubsection{Pouches}
Pouches determine how many items a character can equip for usage during an encounter. Characters naturally have 4 pouches available.

\subsubsection{Rings}
The character can wear a maximum of 2 rings at a time.

\subsubsection{Two-Handing One-Handed Weapons}
When two-handing a one-handed weapon, its \refto{STR} requirement is divided by 2 \emph{rd}. This reduced \refto{STR} requirement does not affect the weapon’s scaling.

\subsubsection{Weapon Scaling \& Upgrades}
Almost all weaponry has minimum Primary Stat requirements, most commonly \refto{STR} and \refto{DEX}. The character’s requisite stats must be equal or greater to the requirement(s) in order to wield a weapon.\\
Weapon damage also scales with these stats according to their ‘weapon scaling grade’. Each scaling grade has a threshold score. A weapon’s damage increases by 1 for each Primary Stat that reaches a multiple of its threshold score over the initial requirement. \\
A weapon’s damage can scale a limited number of times per stat, determined by that stat’s grade. This is listed as ‘Max’ on the table below.\\
A E-grade stat has a requirement, but never increases damage.

\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Example:} A weapon that requires 10 \refto{STR} and has a B scaling grade will gain 1 point of damage when the character reaches 16 \refto{STR}.\\
A weapon with an A grade in \refto{STR} and a B grade in \refto{DEX} can scale its damage a total of 5 times (3 from \refto{STR}, 2 from \refto{DEX}).

\section{The Player Character}
The character is comprised of seven Primary Statistics, each in turn influencing a host of Distributary Values. While this system may appear overly crunchy when filling out the character sheet, it allows for low-drag combat since all the math is done in advance.\\

\subsection{Primary Statistics}
The average starting score for any Primary Stat is 7. The lower limit is 3, and there is no upper limit. Increasing Primary Stats is done through upgrading the character’s Soul (\refto{SL}) during a \reftoit{short reprieve}.\\

\textbf{Vitality (\makeref{VIT})} – Increases Health and natural Physical Defense.\\
\textbf{Endurance (\makeref{END})} – Increases \reftoit{stamina pool} size, max equipment load, and Resistance.\\
\textbf{Strength (\makeref{STR})} – Unlocks some attunements and gear, and scales weapon damage.\\
\textbf{Dexterity (\makeref{DEX})} – Unlocks some attunements and gear, and scales weapon damage.\\
\textbf{Attunement (\makeref{ATT})} – Increases Fire Bonus and Fire Defense; and available \refto{FP} and \refto{POTs}.\\
\textbf{Intelligence (\makeref{INT})} – Unlocks and scales some attunements, raises some Bonuses and Defenses, and influences some weapon scales.\\
\textbf{Faith (\makeref{FTH})} – Unlocks and scales some attunements, raises some Bonuses and Defenses, and influences some weapon scales.\\
\textbf{Humanity (\makeref{HMN})} – A statistic particular to each scenario that determines how human, sane, corporeal, etc the character is. Reduced by suffering defeat or committing certain actions.\\ Losing Humanity often leads to insanity or other undesirable effects. It is normally granted at key points in a scenario, such as defeating a strong encounter. It can be thought of as a sort of lives system.\\
\textbf{Soul (\makeref{SL})} – Effectively the character’s ‘level’. Upgrading \refto{SL} allows the player to increase 1 Primary Stat on their character. Each scenario will utilize some resource for upgrading \refto{SL} (usually souls) and each subsequent upgrade will require a greater expenditure of them.\\
Upgrading \refto{SL} typically costs \emph{\refto{SL}+1} souls for each advancement, where \refto{SL} is the character’s current Soul.

\vfill

\subsection{Distributary Values}
These values are not directly increased via Soul advancement, but are influenced by the Primary Stats.\\

\textbf{Health (\makeref{HP})} – When all \refto{HP} slots are filled with damage tokens, the character is defeated.
\begin{itemize}
\item The character has \refto{HP} slots equal to:\\
2 + \refto{VIT}/2 \emph{rd.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Focus (\makeref{FP})} – Spent to activate attunements.
\begin{itemize}
\item The character has \refto{FP} tokens equal to:\\
2 + \refto{ATT}/2 \emph{rd.}
\end{itemize}

\setlength{\tabcolsep}{11pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}

\textbf{Stamina (\makeref{SP})} – Determines the number of \refto{SP} dice in the character’s \reftoit{stamina pool}, based on their \refto{END} score. These \refto{SP} dice are spent to perform actions during an encounter.
\definecolor{Gray}{gray}{0.85}
\rowcolors{2}{}{Gray}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| }
\hline
\textbf{END Score} & \textbf{\# SP Dice}\\

36-40 & 10\\
\hline
41-45 & 11\\
\hline
46+ & 12\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Potential (\makeref{POT}/\makeref{POTs})} – The number of attunements a character can prepare simultaneously. This is represented via \refto{POTs}: slots that can be written-in with a spell or ability. Some attunements occupy multiple \refto{POTs}.
\begin{itemize}
\item At 8 \refto{ATT}, the first \refto{POT} is unlocked. Then for every 2 \refto{ATT} after 8 (10,12,14…) an additional \refto{POT} is granted.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Equip Load (\makeref{EQP})} – Determines how much \refto{ENC} affects the character’s ability to use \reftoit{Dodge!}
\begin{itemize}
\item \refto{EQP} is equal to \refto{END} - 2.
\end{itemize}

\setlength{\tabcolsep}{6pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}

\columnbreak

\textbf{Encumbrance (\makeref{ENC})} – The total weight of all worn equipment. Most importantly, it determines the \reftoit{Dodge!} reaction, as well as some other actions like Vault and Sprint. It also determines a character’s maximum Move value.

\rowcolors{2}{}{Gray}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| }
\hline
\textbf{ENC vs EQP} & \textbf{\reftoit{Dodge!}}\\
\hline
ENC < EQP/2 \emph{rd} & 3 \refto{SP}.  Move 1!\\
\hline
EQP/2 \emph{rd} <= ENC <= EQP & 4 \refto{SP}. Move 1!\\
\hline
EQP < ENC < EQP*2 & 5 \refto{SP}. No move.\\
\hline
EQP*2 <= ENC & No \reftoit{Dodge!}\\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Bonuses}
Various bonuses to the \refto{PWR} of attunements, also raises defenses of that type.\\

\textbf{Magic Bonus (\makeref{MB})} – Influences the effectiveness of sorcery and \refto{M.DEF}.
\begin{itemize}
\item First \refto{MB} is gained at 10 \refto{INT}
\item Increases by 1 per 6 \refto{INT} over 10
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fire Bonus (\makeref{FB})} – Influences the effectiveness of pyromancy and \refto{F.DEF}.
\begin{itemize}
\item First \refto{FB} is gained at 12 \refto{ATT}
\item Increases by 1 per 8 \refto{ATT} over 12
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dark Bonus (\makeref{DB})} – Influences the effectiveness of witchery and \refto{D.DEF}.
\begin{itemize}
\item First \refto{DB} is gained at 8 \refto{INT} and 8 \refto{FTH}
\item Increases by 1 per 4 \refto{INT} or \refto{FTH} (whichever stat is the lowest) over 8
\end{itemize}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Example:} 10 \refto{INT}, 8 \refto{FTH} would give 1 \refto{DB}.\newline 20 \refto{INT}, 8 \refto{FTH} would still give 1 \refto{DB}.
\end{tcolorbox}
\ \\
\textbf{Light Bonus (\makeref{LB})} – Influences the effectiveness of miracles and \refto{L.DEF}.
\begin{itemize}
\item First \refto{LB} is gained at 10 \refto{FTH}
\item Increases by 1 per 6 \refto{FTH} over 10
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{\fill}
\columnbreak

\subsubsection{Defenses}
Each Defense gives the character a \reftoit{sink} on their character sheet, where they can place incoming damage tokens instead of assigning them to \refto{HP} slots. Some \reftoit{sinks} can also mitigate conditions. These \reftoit{sinks} are cleared at the end of each Round.\\

\textbf{Physical Defense (\makeref{P.DEF})} – Base defenses against Crush, Slash and Pierce damage types.
\begin{itemize}
\item All three Physical damage types share this \reftoit{sink}
\item Increases naturally by 1 at 12 \refto{VIT}, and for every 8 \refto{VIT} over 12
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Magic Defense (\makeref{M.DEF})} – Defenses against Magic and \reftoit{Magical} Crush, Slash, and Pierce damage.
\begin{itemize}
\item Increases naturally by 1 per \refto{MB}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fire Defense (\makeref{F.DEF})} – Defenses against Burn damage.
\begin{itemize}
\item Increases naturally by 1 per \refto{FB}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dark Defense (\makeref{D.DEF})} – Defenses against Withering and Dark damage.
\begin{itemize}
\item Increases naturally by 1 per \refto{DB}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Light Defense (\makeref{L.DEF})} – Defenses against Smite damage.
\begin{itemize}
\item Increases naturally by 1 per \refto{LB}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Resistance (\makeref{RES})} – Defenses against the Disoriented and Staggered conditions; and Poison, Toxic, and Bleed damage (but not the Bleeding condition).
\begin{itemize}
\item Increases naturally by 1 per 12 \refto{END}, and for every 8 \refto{END} over 12
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Poise (\makeref{PS})} – Defenses against the Flinch, Dismounted, Knockback, and Knockdown conditions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Each tile of Knockback uses a \refto{PS} value
\item Cannot be increased naturally
\end{itemize}

\section{Encounter Gameplay}
Combat in \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey} is designed to be fast, deliberate, and mortal. Dice rolls set the stage for each Round of the encounter, but do not outright resolve its events. This allows the player more agency in combat, treating it like a puzzle rather than a roll off.\\
Each encounter takes place on the Hexagon-Tiled Map available at the end of this corebook. Setup instructions dictate where to initially place obstacles, hazards, enemies, and the character--utilizing the map’s hex coordinates.\\
Combat is resolved through a continuous loop of \emph{beats} and \emph{counterbeats}, also known as Turns, in which the player drives the initiative and the encounter responds in vicious kind.\\
The player acts in combat by committing \refto{SP} dice from the character’s \reftoit{stamina pool} to actions and reactions. The enemy does not use \refto{SP} dice, but instead rolls on the encounter table(s). Each encounter table contains entries for all possible dice rolls, which dictate enemy behavior and attacks.\\
Whenever the character depletes their \refto{SP} dice, the \reftoit{stamina pool} is re-rolled. This event also designates a Round, which is used in other mechanics.\\
Encounters usually reward speed and decisiveness. As Rounds accumulate, the encounter will grow more difficult. Whenever the \emph{round tally} strikes a given threshold, a \emph{doom event} will alter the encounter to the characters’ detriment.\\
When an entity’s \refto{HP} slots are filled with damage tokens, that entity is defeated and removed from the game. If the character suffers defeat in this manner, resolve the encounter’s instructions for defeat.\\
\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} Remember that a Round refers to a different gameplay mechanic than a Turn.\\
Turn refers to the series of successive \emph{beats} and \emph{counterbeats}.\\
Round refers to the encapsulating loop, marked by re-rolling the \reftoit{stamina pool}.
\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace*{\fill}
\columnbreak

\subsection{Encounter Setup}
To begin playing through an encounter:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the fluff section to understand the gist of the encounter
\item Grab a fresh copy of the Hexagon-Tiled Map, or erase the marks from an old sheet if it isn’t too cluttered
\item Refer to the encounter’s setup instructions. There should be an accompanying diagram of the map dictating what should go where
\item Begin by drawing any special tiles such as concealment or cover via symbols, cross-hatching, or different colors. Use \emph{light} shading so that the page can be used again
\item Grab an appropriate token or miniature for the character and place them on a valid starting location. Then place any initial entities
\item Grab an index card for each encounter table and write out all the rolls. Many encounter tables have identical result layouts, so cards can be re-used between encounters
\item Write the encounter’s enemy sheet(s) on index cards or scratch paper. Draw \refto{HP} circles and any \reftoit{sinks}, along with short-hand for other stats. See the Entity Concepts section for details
\item Lastly, remember what the victory conditions are for the encounter. Not every encounter revolves around defeating all of its enemies
\end{enumerate}
\pagebreak

\subsection{Encounter Resolution}
\subsubsection{The Round}
An encounter begins with its first Round. Whenever the character would begin their Turn, but their \reftoit{stamina pool} is depleted, the encounter returns to the Round phase instead.\\
\textbf{Instructions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Increment the \emph{round tally} by 1, starting at 1 for the very first Round. Either mark these in a corner of the map, or deposit tokens into a pile
\item Resolve any \emph{doom events} for the current \emph{round tally}
\item Unexhaust all results on the encounter table(s)
\item Clear all damage from shields and \reftoit{sinks}
\item Roll a number of dice according to the character’s \refto{SP} value and set them aside, numbers preserved, on the status sheet’s \reftoit{stamina pool}
\item Remove 1 token of each \emph{Time-Limited - Round} condition from all entity sheets
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Turns}
\textbf{The \emph{Beat}--}\\
During the \emph{beat}, the player spends \refto{SP} dice to commit actions such as moving or attacking.\\
\textbf{Instructions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, assign any trickling damage (such as Poison or Toxic) on the status sheet to \refto{HP} slots
\item The character must commit at least 1 action per \emph{beat}, and may commit a maximum of 2 Simple actions; or 1 Simple action and 1 Dynamic action; or 1 Double action
\item In addition, the character may commit 1 Free action that does not count towards the action minimum or action limit (and it may not be taken last)
\item After all actions are resolved, remove 1 token of each \emph{Time-Limited - Turn} condition from the status sheet
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{The \emph{Counterbeat}--}\\
During the \emph{counterbeat}, the encounter orchestrates itself according to the encounter table(s).\\
\textbf{Instructions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every \emph{beat} must be followed by a \emph{counterbeat}
\item First, assign any trickling damage (such as Poison or Toxic) to enemies’ \refto{HP}
\item Roll on the encounter table. If there are multiple encounter tables, resolve all of the current encounter roll’s behavior before moving onto subsequent tables
\item If a rolled entry is exhausted, resolve the next unexhausted entry to its right instead (looping if necessary)
\item The enemy resolving an encounter roll at any given time is known as the ‘active enemy’. If multiple enemies are controlled by the same table, each active enemy resolves its behavior before moving onto the next enemy
\item The player may commit \refto{SP} dice to a reaction after the active enemy resolves any Move, and before it resolves any attack(s). If the active enemy commits multiple attacks, each attack is given its own reaction window. Reactions like \reftoit{Dodge!} only take effect for a single attack. The character may commit as many reactions per \emph{counterbeat} as they have \refto{SP} dice for, but only one reaction per attack

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Example:} The first enemy attacks the character, who then mitigates that attack with \reftoit{Dodge!}\newline
A second enemy then moves towards the character, and attempts its own attack. The player has run out of \refto{SP} dice, and cannot commit a reaction, and so the second enemy lands its attack on the character.\newline
This same process would hold true for a single enemy attempting two, sequential attacks. Some enemies even have multiple attacks with Move values, allowing them to catch a character moving out of attack range during their reactions.
\end{tcolorbox}

\item Once an encounter roll is resolved, cover that entry with a token. That entry is now exhausted, and will be skipped if it’s rolled again. Some entries may take multiple tokens to become exhausted; this will be specified in the table’s instructions
\item If all entries on an encounter table become exhausted, immediately un-exhaust the entire table
\item After all enemy actions are resolved, remove 1 token of each \emph{Time-Limited - Turn} condition from all enemy sheets
\item Lastly, look at the character’s \emph{stamina pool.} If there are \refto{SP} dice remaining, the encounter goes into another \emph{beat.} However, if the \reftoit{stamina pool} is empty, return to the Round phase
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} For a more detailed overview of how enemies resolve their conditional behavior, see the Entity Concepts section.

\subsection{Gameplay Example}
Here is a full playthrough of an example encounter. This should serve to further explain \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey’s} encounter system, including the setup process.
\subsubsection*{Example Encounter: The Hollowed Adventurer}
\begin{center}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[width = 0.65\textwidth]{misc/example_map.png}
}
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{Setup Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Black:} Impassable Boundary.
\item \textbf{Goldenrod:} Character Start Location.
\item \textbf{Red:} Hollowed Adventurer Start Location.
\item \textbf{Grey:} Bottomless Pit. Any entity that enters this tile is defeated.
\item \textbf{Green:} Retreat Tile. Using the Retreat action on this tile ends the encounter.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Victory Condition}
Defeat the Hollowed Adventurer.

\subsubsection*{Doom Events}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Round 3:} Increase the Hollowed Adventurer’s \refto{P.DEF} value by 1.
\item \textbf{Round 5:} Increase the damage of all the Hollowed Adventurer’s attacks by 1.
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\begin{multicols*}{2}
\subsubsection*{Setting up the Encounter}
First, the player grabs a copy of the Hexagon-Tiled Map. This copy was previously used for another encounter, so they carefully erase all the old marks and \emph{round tallies}. It’s best to draw lightly on the map for this reason.\\
Next, the player notes that this encounter has an impassable boundary. Filling in each perimeter hex would take too much time, and erasing it would be messy, so they draw an outline around the relevant tiles.\\
The retreat and bottomless pit tiles need symbols to distinguish them. The player decides on circles for the pit. For the retreat tile, an arrow pointing North seems appropriate.\\
Lastly, the player puts an American quarter-dollar on the character start location. As for the Hollowed Adventurer, they use a spent 9mm brass casing.\\
The encounter is now ready to play.

\subsubsection*{Studying the Enemy}
Before beginning the encounter, the player decides to look over their opponent. The hollowed adventurer has an enemy sheet, copied here:\\

\hrule
\subsubsection*{Hollowed Adventurer}
\refto{HP}: 13 \hspace*{2cm} \textbf{Move:} 4 \\
\refto{P.DEF}: 1 \\\\
\emph{Hollow:} This entity ignores the Stunned, Charmed, Maddened, and Fear conditions.\\\\
\textbf{Attacks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Shortsword} - Deal 2 Slash damage to an adjacent entity
\item \emph{Wicked Slice} - Move 1. Deal 3 Slash damage. If any damage is assigned to an \refto{HP} slot, this attack also inflicts Bleeding
\item \emph{Flurry} - Deal 2 Slash damage to an adjacent entity. Resolve this attack three times
\end{itemize}
\hrule
\ \\ 
It’s not a particularly threatening opponent, but certainly an obstacle for a beginner character.\\

\columnbreak

The player also notes the encounter’s \emph{doom events}. On Round 3 the hollow will gain an extra point of \refto{P.DEF}, making them slightly harder to wound; and on Round 5 the hollow’s attacks begin to deal more damage. Like most encounters, this one rewards decisive action--it would be best to finish off the hollow before it gains these bonuses.

\subsubsection*{The Hero Enters}
Rather than including an entire character sheet, here are the relevant details for the player’s character:\\
\hrule
\subsubsection*{Genericus}
\refto{HP}: 6 \hspace*{2cm} \refto{P.DEF}: 2\\
\refto{SP}: 4 \hspace*{2.1cm} \textbf{\reftoit{Dodge!}:} 5 SP, No Move\\\\
\textbf{Equipment:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Arming Sword} - Costs 2 \refto{SP}. Deals 2 damage, inflicting either Slash or Pierce. Has the special attack: Lunge
\item \emph{Spear} - Costs 2 \refto{SP}. Deals 2 Pierce damage. Has a range of 2 hexes
\item \emph{Kite Shield} - Has 2 Defense, and 6 Stability. Retains 1 Durability \reftoit{sink}
\item \emph{Sunlit Flask} - Removes up to 3 damage tokens from \refto{HP} slots. Retains 3 charges
\end{itemize}
\hrule
\ \\ \ \\
Genericus is a bog-standard, low-level fighter. He carries two weapons: the arming sword, and his spear. The sword is versatile, and allows him to Lunge an extra tile for attacks. The spear has no special attacks, and cannot perform the Slash moveset, but it has a range of 2 tiles and pairs well with a shield for Guarded Attacks.\\
Genericus also has a bit of a weight problem, making his \reftoit{Dodge!} action cost 5 \refto{SP} and afford no movement. But what he lacks in agility he makes up for with armor. His 2 \refto{P.DEF} will allow him to mitigate 2 Physical damage per Round, and ontop of that he has a kite shield for even further defenses.\\
Looking purely at stats, Genericus appears to be weaker than his opponent. However, he has one major advantage: his player. It’s Genericus’ fight to lose.
\end{multicols*}
\pagebreak

\subsubsection*{The Encounter Table}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Roll:} 1D6
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ L | L | L }
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{1}} & 
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{2-5}} & 
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{6}} \\
\textbf{A:} \emph{Flurry}\newline \textbf{B:} Move. \emph{Shortsword} &
Move. \emph{Shortsword}\newline \emph{This result is only exhausted after its third token} &
\emph{Sudden. Wicked Slice}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{multicols*}{2}
\subsubsection*{The Encounter Begins}
With setup complete and the two opponents’ statistics outlined on the previous page, it’s finally time to play the encounter. The encounter table has a common layout, so the player grabs an index card previously prepared with its rolls written out: 1, 2-5, and 6.
\subsubsection*{Round 1--}
Encounters always open on a Round. There isn’t much for the player to do besides mark the first \emph{round tally} in the map’s top right corner, and roll their \emph{stamina pool.} The 4 \refto{SP} dice come out: 2, 3, 3, 3.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Beat}}
The player looks over their opening moves. With this distance and no ranged weapon, Genericus lacks any opportunity to damage the hollow this Turn. But he still needs to take at least one action per \emph{beat.} The hollow has a Move value of 4, meaning it can get as close as \emph{6,8} or \emph{6,9} during the \emph{counterbeat.}\\
The player spends their 2-score dice to move Genericus to \emph{8,7}, and ends the Turn there. This will hopefully put him in range for a Light Attack next Turn.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Counterbeat}}
The player rolls 1D6 on the encounter table and checks the result: a 1. This would be bad if Genericus was in range for that \emph{Flurry} attack under the \textbf{A} behavior. However, since the enemy cannot resolve \textbf{A’s} attack, they move onto \textbf{B}: a Move and a \emph{Shortsword} attack.\\
The hollow still can’t resolve its \emph{Shortsword} attack, but it will still commit the listed Move regardless. The hollow moves 4 hexes towards Genericus via the shortest logical route, landing on \emph{6,8}. The player then covers the encounter table’s 1 result with a coin, marking it as exhausted, and ends the Turn.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Beat}}
As predicted, Genericus is now within range for an attack--with his arming sword in one hand and the kite shield in his other. He could also use a Free action to switch to the spear, or even two-hand the sword, but the player has other plans.\\
They spend one of their 3-score dice to commit Light Attack, using its implicit Move to send Genericus forward to \emph{7,7}. This attack deals 2 Slash damage. One of these Physical damage tokens ends up in the hollow’s \refto{P.DEF} \reftoit{sink}; the other token reduces it to 12 \refto{HP}.\\
But the Turn isn’t over yet. That attack was a Dynamic action--Genericus can still perform a Simple action. The player decides to commit \reftoit{Shield Up!}, spending another 3-score die.
\begin{center}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[width = 0.2\textwidth]{misc/example_map2.png}
}\\
\emph{Genericus and the hollow face off at the edge of a bottomless pit.}
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{\emph{Counterbeat}}
The player rolls on the encounter table again, coming up with a 6. Since this result is \emph{Sudden}, it prevents the player from committing a reaction--but thankfully, Genericus already has \reftoit{Shield Up!} ready.\\
\emph{Wicked Slice’s} first 2 Slash damage (the shield’s Defense value) is placed on \reftoit{Shield Up!} and the third token is assigned to \refto{P.DEF}. Because no damage was assigned to \refto{HP} slots, Genericus avoids being afflicted with Bleeding. The player exhausts the encounter table’s 6 result and ends the Turn.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Beat}}
The player decides to ditch the shield in favor of more damage, using the Free action Swap Equipment to two-hand the arming sword. Genericus only has one \refto{SP} die left, his last 3-score, and so the player spends it on a Heavy Attack. With a base damage of 2 and 1 \refto{SP} overspent, this attack will deal 3 Slash damage.\\
Since the hollow’s \refto{P.DEF} was already zeroed by the previous attack, this Heavy Attack reduces the hollow’s \refto{HP} from 12 to 9.
\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} The player could also use the arming sword to inflict Pierce instead of Slash damage, but it’s irrelevant in this situation.
\end{tcolorbox}
\subsubsection*{\emph{Counterbeat}}
The encounter roll comes up with another 1. Since the 1 result is already exhausted, the player resolves the next result to its right: 2-5. The hollow doesn’t need to Move since it’s already adjacent to Genericus, and so it goes right into the \emph{Shortsword} attack. Genericus lacks any \refto{SP} dice for a reaction, so he’s forced to eat both Slash damage tokens. The first is \reftoit{sunk} in his \refto{P.DEF}--the second reduces his \refto{HP} to 5.\\
Since the \reftoit{stamina pool} is now empty, instead of another \emph{beat} this encounter goes back to the Round phase.

\subsubsection*{Round 2--}
It is now Round 2, so the player marks a second tally in the top right corner. The encounter table is cleared of its tokens. Then, all damage tokens are removed from both \refto{P.DEF} \reftoit{sinks}, as well as \reftoit{Shield Up!} The rolls for the \reftoit{stamina pool} come out: 1,2,2,3.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Beat}}
The bad news this Round is that the player rolled poorly for \refto{SP} dice. But this does not render them totally impotent.\\
They commit the 3-score dice to another Heavy Attack, dealing 3 Slash damage. This eats through the hollow’s \refto{P.DEF} and drops it to 7 \refto{HP}.\\
The player then uses a Free action to re-equip the kite shield. Finally, they bring \reftoit{Shield Up!} back, spending a 2-score die.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Counterbeat}}
The encounter roll is a 3. The hollow performs another \emph{Shortsword} attack, landing 2 damage tokens on \reftoit{Shield Up!} Then a coin is placed on the 2-5 result. According to its instructions, this 2-5 result will not become exhausted until its third token.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Beat}}
With \reftoit{Shield Up!} stable, and the hollow at half health, the player decides to press their advantage. For 3 \refto{SP}, the player can commit Guarded Attack, which allows them to attack with Pierce damage and not lose their shield’s defenses. In order to meet the \refto{SP} requirement, the player commits both their remaining 1-score and 2-score dice. The hollow drops to 5 \refto{HP}.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Counterbeat}}
Disaster strikes when the player rolls a 1 on the encounter table. \emph{Flurry’s} first 4 damage go onto \reftoit{Shield Up!} but the fifth token inflicts \reftoit{Guard Break}. Since Genericus is already out of \refto{SP} dice, Flinch has no effect, but he still suffers Stun and loses 1 Durability on his kite shield. The sixth Slash damage token is \reftoit{sunk} in his \refto{P.DEF}.\\
Due to the empty \reftoit{stamina pool}, the encounter returns to the Round phase once again.

\subsubsection*{Round 3--}
With the coming of Round 3, things get even worse. A \emph{doom event} brings the hollow’s \refto{P.DEF} up to 2. Furthermore, Genericus is still Stunned and won’t be able to act on his first Turn. After clearing the encounter table, \reftoit{Shield Up!}, and both \reftoit{sinks}; the player’s \reftoit{stamina pool} rolls come out: 2,2,3,6.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Beat}}
Genericus cannot commit any actions due to Stun. The player removes the Stun condition token from his status sheet at the end of the Turn.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Counterbeat}}
The encounter roll comes up 4. The player could commit \reftoit{Dodge!} or even \reftoit{Shield Up!} again, but they want to save those \refto{SP} dice for ending this encounter ASAP. They deposit both damage tokens in \refto{P.DEF}.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Beat}}
The player commits one 2-score dice, and Moves to \emph{7,8}. Since Kick is also a Simple action, they could easily just send the hollow into the pit and end the encounter now. The player glances at the encounter results page (which is perfectly legal) and sees that kicking the hollow down the pit will deprive them of its souls and loot. To get anything out of this encounter, they must defeat the hollow the hard way.\\
The player decides on two-handing the arming sword again for another Heavy Attack, spending the 6-score die. This 4 Slash damage (the arming sword’s maximum) eats through the 2 \refto{P.DEF}. The hollow is now at 3 \refto{HP}.
\begin{center}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[width = 0.2\textwidth]{misc/example_map3.png}
}\\
\emph{Genericus considers sending the hollow over the edge.}
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{\emph{Counterbeat}}
The encounter table roll is another 1. With his \refto{P.DEF} gone, \emph{Flurry’s} 6 combined Slash damage would defeat Genericus. And since Genericus is two-handing his sword, committing \reftoit{Shield Up!} as a reaction isn’t an option. The player’s least odious solution is to commit \reftoit{Dodge!} for that first swing, and eat the remaining 4 damage. Since \reftoit{Dodge!} costs 5 \refto{SP}, this will require both the remaining 2-score and 3-score \refto{SP} dice, and the Round will end.\\
The player goes ahead and commits their remaining dice to saving Genericus. His \refto{HP} drops from 5 to 1.

\subsubsection*{Round 4--}
The player knows it’s do or die on Round 4. They mark the third \emph{round tally}, clear tokens from the usual places, and roll for their \reftoit{stamina pool}: 1,2,3,5.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Beat}}
Genericus will need to put out 5 damage to defeat the hollow. His highest possible damage output is 4 with a Heavy Attack, so this means a minimum of two attacks. But two separate encounter rolls, \emph{Flurry} and \emph{Wicked Slice} could easily defeat Genericus in a single \emph{counterbeat}--that’s two out of six rolls, a 33\% chance of defeat.\\
The player comes up with a simple strategy to ensure victory without having to Kick the hollow into the pit and lose out on the encounter rewards. First, they use a Free action to switch Genericus’ equipment to his spear and kite shield.\\
Next, the player spends the 2-score die to commit a Light Attack with the spear. This takes care of the hollow’s 2 \refto{P.DEF}.\\
Then the player commits the 3-score die to move Genericus to \emph{9,9}.
\begin{center}
\framebox{
\includegraphics[width = 0.2\textwidth]{misc/example_map4.png}
}\\
\emph{Genericus enacts the plan.}
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{\emph{Counterbeat}}
The player rolls a 6 on the encounter table. This result may not have a Move, but the \emph{Wicked Slice} attack does have an implicit Move 1. The hollow moves to \emph{7,8}. This is exactly what the player was hoping for.
\subsubsection*{\emph{Beat}}
Now it’s time to finish the encounter. The player two-hands the spear and commits the 5-score die to a Heavy Attack (from 2 hexes away), dealing 4 Pierce damage and killing the hollow.

\subsubsection*{After the Battle}
The player checks the encounter’s rewards again: 20 souls, a shortsword, and some leather armor.\\
Despite winning the encounter, Genericus is not in great shape. Thankfully, the player can use a charge of the sunlit flask to regain 3 \refto{HP}, even outside of combat. But the kite shield is now at 0 Durability and at risk of breaking. Genericus could easily be looking at two or three more encounters before his next \reftoit{short reprieve}, where even one encounter might now prove fatal. In \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey}, small mistakes often end up compounding across a chapter.

Miracles are chants that summon divine aid, and are always accompanied by the ringing of chimes. The rituals require little concentration, but are tiring.

\section{Afterword}
\begin{multicols*}{2}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
While \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey} will be released alongside the \emph{Everloyal} companion scenario (with additional scenarios forthcoming), any hobbyist game designer can use the highly modular rules found within this corebook to create their own adventures. The flexibility of the encounter system and the simplicity of the CYOA format should allow any reader with a taste for game design to channel their creativity into an interesting scenario. And for the players, each new scenario will join a collection of adventures unified under a familiar pen \& paper system.\\
When embarking upon the labor of writing a scenario, it would be wise to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Play all the way through the companion scenario first. Ensure that you understand the encounter mechanics and how it feels to interact with them.
\item Before planning out an entire scenario, begin by designing a few test encounters and playing through them yourself.
\item Feel free to modify the rules and add new statistics, attunements, damage types, conditions, etc.
\item If you alter the character’s Primary Statistics or Distributary Values, it would be polite to create new character and status sheets for players to track them with.
\item Can you design an encounter wholly different from what you’ve already seen? How far can you stretch this system? Does it always need to be combat-oriented?
\item Get creative with your setting. Not every scenario needs to be a Dark Medieval Fantasy. What other sorts of adventures can you come up with?
\item Clearly dictate all actions, rules, and their exceptions to the player. This is the only section of the scenario book where you should leave little room for imagination.
\item Your scenario can only benefit from rigorous playtesting with various types (and Soul levels) of characters.
\end{itemize}

This corebook is a living document. Common issues, questions, and quality-of-life improvements will be tracked in the following Version History section.\\
Lastly, always defer to the ‘house rules’ of the scenario book over anything found in this corebook.\\
\begin{flushright}
Enjoy your game!\\
